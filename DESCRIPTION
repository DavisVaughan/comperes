Description: Tools for storing and managing competition results. Competition is
    understood as a set of games in which players gain some abstract scores.
    There are two ways for storing results: in long (one row per game-player)
    and wide (one row per game with fixed amount of players) formats. This
    package provides functions for creation and conversion between them. Also
    there are functions for computing their summary and Head-to-Head values for
    players. They leverage grammar of data manipulation from 'dplyr'.
